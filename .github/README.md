A Template for Verilog Projects (using `iverilog` and `gtkwave`).

* All test-bench's must be named as `*_tb.v` and be placed within the `tests/dir`.
* This template includes a recommended extension for vscode and the necessary settins to make the extension work with the provided directory structure.
* The `Makefile` is inspired from [@pwmarcz's work](https://github.com/pwmarcz/fpga-tools/blob/master/fpga.mk).
